	=> Other name of waterfall model is  linear 
		sequential model
	=> It is accomplish with all SDLC phases
		Requirements, Analysis, Design, Coding,Testing,Release
	=> In waterall model all developement phases
		build in linear fashion [One after one]


	Advantages:-->
		=> Usefull to build known domain
		=> Usefull to manage smaller projects
		=> Low risk model

	Disadvantages:-->
		=> Not welcoming changes during developement
		=> Can't run two phases parallel
		=> Testing phase only start after development phase completed


Incremental Model:-->
		=> Other name of incremental model is
			multi-waterfall life cycle model

		=> Multiple developement life cycles
			implement during this model

		=> During this model software requirements
			converted into smaller iterations
			and each iteration follow all
			SDLC phases to develop software

		=> Second iteration  start based on first
			iteration feedback


		Advantages:-->
			
		=> Generates working software quickly and early 
		   during the software life cycle.

		=>  More flexible – less costly to change scope 
		    and requirements.

		=> Smaller iterations are easy to develop and
			Test
		
		Disadvantages:-->
		
		=> Organization should recruite separate 
			Risk analysis team to identify possible
			risks at initial stage

		=> Separate devops team required to manage
			more iterations


Spiral Model:-->
		
		=> It is a combination of waterfall model
			and incremental model
		=> Othername of spiral model is Bigbang model

		=> Ogranization preffer this model to develop
		   missionary projects. These projects start
		   for different purpose and finally end with
		   differnt purpose
		
		=> Each Spiral consists of a deliverable product
		=> Feedback of each spiral is incorporated 
			in the next spiral 
		=> Customer can start using the system after 
			every spiral
		=> Each Spiral consists of a waterfall model
			phases

		
		Advantages:-->
			=> Quick software release in SDLC
		
		Dis-Advantages:-->
			=> Highly expertise risk analysis team
			   requied 
			=> Costly model to use

ProtoType model:-->

		=> Organization follow prototype model
			when client doesn't know any thing
			about software developement.

		=> During this model organization build
			working prototypes based on initial
			client requirements

		=> The working prototypes helps customer
			to ask original requirements

		
		Advatages:-->
			
			=> Requirements are frozen at early stage
			
			=> Working prototypes helps customer to 
				visuvalise software requirements
			=> Usefull when new domain projects development.

		Dis-Advantages:-->
		
			=> It is difficult to maintain documentation
				or designs when prototypes are changing
				time to time


Rapid Developemet Model[RAD]:-->
		=> RAD is a high speed linear adoption model.
			
		=> Organization follow RAD model whenever end to 
			end software need to develop with in shot
			span of time.   

		=> Where software need to develop in [30-90]
			days period

		=> During this model software is divided into
			equal components and each component
			separate team involve to finish quickly

		=> Developers use reusable construction of programs
			to develop software early.

		Advantages :
		  => Very short cycle time
		  => Use of working components lead to minimum 
			defects

		Dis-advantages:-->
		=> System softwares can't be modularized
		


V-Model:-->
		=> Verificaton and validation model
		=> V-Model give equal weight to testing
			as compare with development
		=> Testers start testing activities
			early as compare to development

		=> Early testing cut down defect cost


	Verification Testing:-->

		=> Also known as static Testing
		=> It is a document level testing
		   during this test testing team
		   conduct reviews and walkthroughs
		   on project documentation
		=> It is a defect preventive approach.
		=> Testing conduct before development
		=> Testers check Are we developing right software ?


	Validation Testing:-->
		=> Also known as dynamic Testing
		=> it is a software level testing
		    during this test testing team
		    validate developed software
		    by operating it..
		=> It is defect detective approach
		=> Testers involve after development of software
		=> Testers check is developed sofware
		   meeting with client expectations.


Agile model:-->
	
	=> An agile most important charecterstics it is	
		based on iterations,During this model
		software developed in number of iterations.

	=> Each iteration in agile a small period of time
	   where selected requirements can develop,test
	   and release to the client	

	=> During agile model large requirements converted
		into small box sized requirements

	=> Each iteration passes through all phases of 
		SDLC

	=> Agile title suggested from agility and adoptability
	
	=> Agile is a combination of prototype and Rapid development model

	=> All designs are kept in stone and open at last minutes..

	=> Each iteration is delivarable product so that client
		can utitlize software features..
	

	Advantages of agile model:-->
		
	=> Instead of one time schedule, agile models involve in 
	   multiple iterative development schedules that seek to 
	   improve the output with every iteration.

	=> Welcome change requirements during middle of the development
